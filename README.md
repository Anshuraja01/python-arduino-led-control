# 🔌 Python-Arduino LED Control

This project demonstrates how to control an LED connected to an Arduino board using Python via serial communication. You can turn the LED **ON** or **OFF** directly from your Python script.

## 📦 Features

- Control an LED using simple Python commands
- Establish serial communication between Python and Arduino
- Basic ON/OFF command interface
- Can be extended to control other Arduino components

## 🛠️ Requirements

### Hardware:
- Arduino UNO (or compatible board)
- LED
- 220Ω resistor
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard

### Software:
- [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
- Python 3.x
- `pyserial` library
